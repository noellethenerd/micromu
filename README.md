Recreating the mi:mu in microbit
# About the project
We are an engineer and a musician who were brought together by our desire to give a voice to those underrepresented in the music industry. We sought to give disabled individuals high quality music and technology opportunities. Through the MyNormal project at Ark T Centre, we developed workshops and Hackathons around building accessible instruments. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci-yB6EgVW4">Imogen Heap's mi.mu gloves</a href>, we use micro:bits, Makey-Makeys, laptops, speakers, bananas, and cubes to empower individuals to interact with music in ways they've never done before. ScienceOxford is supporting the project, lending kit, equipment, and machine time.
